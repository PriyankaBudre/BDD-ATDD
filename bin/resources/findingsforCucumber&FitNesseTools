As per my thinking cucumber is the better tool over FitNesse as cucumber is based on requirements and
 fulfilling user requirements is whole and sole purpose of developing software.
Cucumber also gets executed faster than FitNesse
Cucumber took 50.761 seconds whereas FitNesse took 52.555 seconds to 8 small scenarios.

it is easy in cucumber to track the requirements where as in FitNesse we need track requirements seperatly.
